## Teaching at Imperial College 

I support the teaching for various modules at Imperial College including: 

4th Year Master's course [Machine Learning for Materials](https://aronwalsh.github.io/MLforMaterials/Overview.html)

I also run tutorials for maths students in first year of material science. Topics include ODEs, linear algebra and complex numbers
